This repository contains the code for loading a data file containing course information,
storing it, sorting it, and allowing the user to see a course or see all courses available. 
This has 3 files: a reflection on the course, the working C++ code that implements all this with a text-based menu,
and earlier pseudo-code and runtime analysis for these algorithms. While my original pseudocode and runtime analysis also included hash table and binary search tree analyses, here, I limited it to analysis of a vector approach, as that is the one I actually used.
